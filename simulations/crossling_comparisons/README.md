# Cross-linguistic RSA model simulations

These files visualize model simulations run by Angelique and Manh for French, Vietnamese, English, and Spanish in summer 2022. Examples of contexts are included [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qz75wTGdWi0Bi9LjRa4trHBhBVv0APd0NnyURoMMuHk/edit?usp=sharing).

`data` contains the data (simulated production probabilities) as manually entered into [this Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cj2Y4GLFNQPoW1eoIkCFzxrdtzFEOaPGDMvpjqP4E5k/edit?usp=sharing). **To do**: migrate to command-line generated simulations only.

`rscripts` contains R scripts that generate visualizations from simulated data.

`graphs` contains visualizations.
