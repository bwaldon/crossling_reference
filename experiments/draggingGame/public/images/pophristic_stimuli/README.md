# General

The original images were taken from freepik.com and unsplash.com. The majority of the images are photographs. Some images are CGI generated and meant to look realistic (e.g. the necklace, ruler, shovel, bonbon, fork, etc.).

Images were edited in photoshop whereby:
1. their background was removed
2. they were each given four colors

Stefan Pophristic has the photoshop files of all the images along with higher quality versions of each image. Reach out to him if you want to make any modifications. You can also find them in the StefanPophristic/stimuli/visual/2021_ALPS_RSA github repo.
