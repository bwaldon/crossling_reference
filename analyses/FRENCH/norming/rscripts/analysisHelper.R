# Take in data frame and count utterances for each color_object pairing
#
# Filtering participants by their status as a {native, heritage, 
# Macedonian/Slovenian, or foreign} speaker of BCS can be done in this script
# (e.g. see line commented out line #44), but I recommend doing it in the 
# individual analysis script, because making the change here will change it for 
# all analyses that rely on this script
#
## INPUT:
# dataframe: dataframe ending in -merged.csv 
#
## OUTPUT:
# df_split: a list of tibbles
# Each tibble contains all the color_object pairings for a given object
#   along with all responses given to each of those color_object pairings
#   and how many times participants gave each response
# Each tibble is called by the object it is counting (e.g. "book")
# 
# For example:
# df_split["book"]
# # A tibble: 3 Ã— 4
# Groups:   object [2]
# object       cresponse count utt  
# <fct>        <chr>     <int> <chr>
# 1 blue_book  kniga         1 book 
# 2 blue_book  knjiga        2 book 
# 3 white_book knjiga        1 book
